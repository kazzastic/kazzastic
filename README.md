# Hello !

### I'm an aspiring Master's student in the University of Passau, my degree is in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. 

I am an avid open source contributor mostly based on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949369/kazim-raza). I like to be up-to-date with web based frameworks my recent favourite framework would be FastAPI. 

Projects: 

- [Classification and Segmentation of Breast Cancer using Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/kazzastic/Breast-Cancer-Lump-Segmentation-MaskRCNN) 
This was a government funded project which I did during my bachelor year. The reason I find this project to be my all time favourite is due to the fact that it was the point where I started understanding deep learning vivdely. And another factor could be that I was fully involved in making each step of this project, whether it be data gathering, analysis, engineering, training and then finally making a fully functional web based application, deplyoing the front and backend. I was also able to publish this research on the web, you can check it [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-523546/v1)

- [Machine Learning based Models For Early Screening & Detection Of Hematologic Cancer Using Cell Population Data](https://github.com/syedshameersarwar/HematologicCancer)
For the completion of my bachelow degree program I had to complete a 2 semester long thesis. This research was the topic and implementation of my thesis which can be further explored. This project was done in collaboration with NIBD(National Institute of Blood Diseases). I was yet again involved in making this project end to end. From data gathering, analysis, feature extraction, feature selection, feature engineering, training and then further developing a web based interface on Vue.js and backedn using Express.js along with Flask for machine learning inferences. 

- [Visual Landmarks Recognition of Urban Structures using Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/kazzastic/REST-API-neural-net)
During my 4th semester I landed an incredile research internship at the National Center for Artificial Intelligence(NCAI, NED-UET). I contributed towards an ongoing visual positioning system project by introducing Convolution Neural Network technique in order to classify building. I was also able to publish a part of this huge project which can be further explored [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9073795)

Further more my current tech stack would be, 
- FastAPI and Flask 
- Pyspark
- AWS, EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis etc
- GCP, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions, Compute Engine, BigQuery, Artifact Registry etc
- Airbyte
- Databricks, Delta Tables etc
- Redash, Superset etc
- Docker and Kubernetes, on-prem and cloud managed

I recenlty got hands on with end-to-end pipelining with kubernetes on Google Cloud [Docker and K8s deployment pipelining](https://github.com/kazzastic/GKE-gitAction-pipeline)
